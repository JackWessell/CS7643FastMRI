# CS7643FastMRI
This repository contains the code for training a variety of convolutional vision transformer models on the Facebook's FastMRI dataset. To get started with the repo, first request access to the FastMRI dataset here: https://fastmri.med.nyu.edu/.
Then, start a new conda environment using the included requirements.txt file.
All custom models are included in mymodels.py and can be trained using train_model.py. Code in other .py files is used with slight modifications and credit is given accordingly in associated README files.
